        <h1>Week 3: Data Scrape</h1>
        <p>
            I was thinking about why the hello kitty cartoon has become popular in China once again in the recent past. I have taken images and words from 'hello kitty', 'anthropomorphism', 'cat', 'gender', 'character' and "character", and images and words.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I dug deeper into the story behind hello kitty's image, I found it hard to ignore the anthropomorphic nature behind it. Contrary to popular belief, hello kitty is not a kitten animal figure, but a little girl born around England with a cheerful and lively personality, gentle and enthusiastic, mischievous and loving to make friends, an amalgamation of all little girls. For the Chinese girls who love her Xu has her as a kind of aspirant to her own goodness, stubborn and not easy to please, yet warm and loving, brave and stubborn, always enjoying playing the adult, wanting everyone around her to be happy even when they are hurting themselves.
